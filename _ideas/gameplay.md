# Interesting/good aspects
_cool stuff you wanna do_

## Bottlenecks
solving bottlenecks and automating with progression feels really good.

on old basewars, you'd also eventually get the bank and not have to collect the money every 5 seconds and then the paper dispenser to essentially get rid of the paper refilling part. all of this felt pretty good and significant; trimming base management time is almost always a no-brainer; with how cheap all of these were it was a must-have AS SOON AS YOU REACH THE LEVEL.

# Problems

## Fighting (_not raiding_)

...fucking sucked because of drugs (@ hexa) and regen/mobility.

* Drugs
  on perilous i tried to fix the issue by restricting the drugs to drug-labs instead of shops, making them expensive to make (but only time-wise) and easy to lose. it kinda worked, but in a roundabout way: instead of balancing the drugs out, barely anyone used the drugs due to how ass drug management was. you'd need to restart the drug lab every 5 minutes to make a new drug then put the old drugs somewhere or maybe sort them and dealing with source physics and... all of this sucked and was not fun.

  i don't know whether i still want the drugs system; sure, it would be nice to have these buffs to give people something to do, but would it put more grindy players at a huge advantage compared to those who aren't really interested in them? would it become super meta to pump yourself full of steroids before every fight? idunno!

* Regen & Mobility
	regen drags out fights, significantly. on perilous, i tried to balance it out with medkits and armorkits which took time to kick in and would stop if you took damage, intending it to be a risk/reward: you could either try and kill/suppress the enemy, or you could try to heal up and hope he wouldn't come to kick your lowhp ass (since peeking == stop healing).
	instead, both parties just took the nearest cover and took the ~5s to heal up to full and start over with 350hp. this REALLY dragged out the fights and essentially came down to `who can laser down the other before they can react and duck for cover`.
	lack of mobility didn't help either, considering all you were limited to is a slow sprint and no hip-shooting, making it EXTREMELY easy to run away and heal up.

## Bases
the base almost never mattered beyond `how much money it makes`. put up the cheapest dispensers and boom, you literally never have to visit the base except to withdraw the bank or put up new printers (which almost didn't even matter). yes, you get the newer tier of printers, then what? you already have the FFAR which is a meta gun; you already have every dispenser; what else do you need?

## Raiding
...was kind of lame imo.

all you needed were oneways and a shit load of props stacked in a hallway. bonus points if the props were hollow but blocked passage; you could just shoot the attacker down who's at a disadvantage because a) this is not their base b) they already have the blowtorch up so you can catch them with their pants down.

tesla coils were the worst shit ever; i don't know who thought they were even a good idea

sticking around in your base and just waiting until the attacker comes up and starts blowtorching your shit was pretty boring as well.
the problem comes down to there being one meta in how to defend your base: sit still and abuse your base. oneways, wallpen, blowtorch disadvantage, base layout advantage, dispensers advantage, controlling the doors; all of these encourage chilling around in your base and let the attacker come to you.

another issue is the fact that every high-tier printer was apparently a magdump; you could literally use a T4 as a goddamn 7k hp wall

## Progression
  ...was very lame

  from weapons you'd get first a crowbar (why the FUCK would you want a crowbar) then a bunch of trash-tier pistols then a serbu shotty (trash) then a mac-11 (pretty good? wtf???) then a bunch of trash-tier assault rifles and then a fucking mosin (god-tier)
you really didn't need anything else after the FFAR, it was game over by then. all of the ARs and SMGs were pretty much equal except the FFAR.

the entity selection was very boring as well; ammo/armor/health -> ammo t2/armor t2/health t2. wow. epic.
